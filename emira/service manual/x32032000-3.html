					<h3>Power Assisted Steering Bleeding</h3>
					
						<li>Raise and support vehicle. <a href="x00100001-1.html#">Refer to procedure.</a>
						</li>
					
					
						<li>Check power steering fluid reservoir level and top up if necessary. Refer to technical data.</li>
					
					
						<li>With the engine NOT running, turn steering wheel from lock-to-lock.</li>
					
					
						<li>Check power steering fluid reservoir level and top up if necessary.</li>
					
					
						<li>Once power steering fluid reservoir level  remains static, start engine and continue turning steering wheel from lock-to-lock.</li>
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="caution"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/caution.png" />CAUTION: Do not hold steering on full lock as this will cause damage to the pump. </p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Check power steering fluid reservoir level and top up if necessary.</li>
					
					
						<li>Once steering action feels smooth and consistent, and power steering fluid reservoir level remains static, lower vehicle and turn steering again from lock-to-lock to see if it remains smooth and consistent under load.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Vehicle ramps or polished painted workshop floors offer little resistance. If necessary position vehicle on a normal road surface to determine if steering action is acceptable.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>If the steering action is acceptable, check power steering fluid reservoir level and top up if necessary. No further action is required.</li>
					
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<h3>Power Assisted Steering Pressure Bleeding</h3>
					
						<li>Using hand vacuum pump MITYVAC MV8500, install modified cap to power steering fluid reservoir and secure other end of hose to liquid/vapour separator tank. Use second hose to connect liquid/vapour separator tank to vacuum pump.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Ensure liquid/vapour separator tank is higher than the power steering fluid reservoir.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>With vacuum pump securely connected, apply a maximum vacuum of -65 kPa / 20-25 inHg.
						</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Observe vacuum level for 1 minute. If level drops, this indicates there is an air leak. Investigate and rectify source of leak.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>With all wheels on ground and vacuum applied, start vehicle and slowly turn steering from lock-to-lock for approximately 10-15 cycles.</li>
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="caution"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/caution.png" />CAUTION: Do not hold steering on full lock as this will cause damage to the pump.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Check power steering fluid reservoir level and top up if necessary.</li>
					
					
						<li>Release vacuum, remove modified cap from power steering fluid reservoir and replace original reservoir cap.</li>
					
					
						<li>If intermittent steering is still present after vacuum bleeding, position vehicle on a normal road surface, increase engine speed to 1250 rpm to raise power steering pump flow to maximum and turn steering wheel from lock-to-lock.</li>
