			<h3>Repairs and Replacements</h3>
			<p class="topic_para">When replacement parts are required, it is essential that
only Lotus recommended parts are used. Attention is particularly
drawn to the following points concerning repairs and the fitting
of replacement parts and accessories. Safety features and corrosion
prevention treatments embodied in the car may be impaired if other
than Lotus recommended parts are fitted. In certain territories,
legislation prohibits the fitting of parts not to the manufacturer's
specification. Torque wrench setting figures given in this Manual
must be used. Locking type fixings, where specified, must be fitted.
If a locking fixing is disturbed or removed during a procedure then
its efficiency is impaired and it must be renewed. Owners purchasing
accessories while travelling abroad should ensure that the accessory
and its fitted location on the car conform to legal requirements. The
Terms of the vehicle Warranty may be invalidated by the fitting
of other than Lotus recommended parts.All Lotus recommended parts
have the full backing of the vehicle Warranty. Lotus Dealers are
obliged to supply only Lotus recommended parts.</p>

			<h3>Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)</h3>
			<p class="topic_para">The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a unique 17-digit
number used to identify the car for licensing, warranty, spares
ordering and administrative purposes.</p>
			<p class="topic_para">The VIN comprises 17 characters, coded in accordance with
European Economic Community (EEC) directives, and with those of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA). For change
point identification in Service Notes, Service Bulletins and Service
Parts Lists, typically, only characters 10 (model year), and 14
to 17 (serial number) will be quoted. For example 'N 1234' being
2022 model year, serial number 1234.</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Note that the serial number sequence re-starts at 0001 for
each model year, and is shared with all other Lotus models.</p>
			<p class="topic_para">The full VIN should always be quoted with any vehicle enquiries,
together with the engine number if the query is engine related.
Factory records are filed against VIN and specification change points
are identified by VIN or engine number. </p>
			<p class="topic_para">VIN or engine number can be found in the following locations
on the vehicle.</p>
