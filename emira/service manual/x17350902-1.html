					<h3 class="procedure-intro">Procedure Introduction</h3>
					
						<div><p class="note">NOTE: If renewing curtain airbag module due to deployment, the ECU - airbag control must also be renewed, refer to procedure.</p></div>
					
				
				<ol>
					<h3>Removal</h3>
					
						<li>Disconnect battery. <a href="x17311301-1.html#">Refer to procedure.</a>
						</li>
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: Refer to all warnings and cautions before working on the SRS system.</p></div>
						
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: The Sensor and Diagnostic Module (SDM) can maintain sufficient voltage to cause an airbag deployment for up to 20 seconds after the battery has been disconnected. Before working on the airbag system, or in close proximity to an airbag, wait at least 30 seconds before commencing work.</p></div>
						
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: Safety precautions must be observed when handling a deployed inflator module. After deployment, the air bag surface may contain a white packing powder used to ease deployment. Always wear gloves and safety glasses when handling a deployed inflator module and wash your hands with a mild soap and water afterwards.</p></div>
						
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: When working on the SRS system, correct PPE should be worn at all times including an anti-static wrist band.</p></div>
						
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Before disconnecting the battery read any stored trouble codes.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Remove headlining. <a href="x12040302-1.html#">Refer to procedure.</a>
						</li>
					
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm1035.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Remove M6 screws (x5) and washers (x4) securing airbag curtain to A pillar.  <span class="torque">Torque 9 Nm.</span>
						</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Always record quantity and fitted position of washers.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm1036.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Remove M6 nuts (x2) securing airbag curtain to vehicle.  <span class="torque">Torque 9 Nm.</span>

						<li>Remove airbag curtain.</li>
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: When carrying a live inflator module, make sure the bag and trim cover are pointed away from you. In case of an accidental deployment, the bag will then deploy with minimal chance of injury.</p></div>
						
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: When placing a live inflator module on a bench or other surface, always face the bag and trim cover upwards, away from the surface. This is necessary so that a free space is provided to allow the air bag to expand in the unlikely event of accidental deployment. Otherwise, personal injury may result.</p></div>
						
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: Never carry the inflator module by the wires or connector on the underside of the module.</p></div>

					<h3>Installation</h3>
					
						<li>Installation is the reverse of removal procedure except for the following:</li>
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: Failure to follow proper SRS inflator module disposal procedures can result in airbag deployment which may cause personal injury. Undeployed inflator modules must not be disposed of through normal refuse channels. The undeployed inflator module contains substances that can cause severe illness or personal injury if the sealed container is damaged during disposal. Disposal in any manner inconsistent with proper procedures may be a violation of federal, state and/or local laws.</p></div>
						
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: The stalk module MUST be replaced after SRS deployment even if there is no visible damage.</p></div>
