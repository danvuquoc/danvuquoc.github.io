		<div id="topic">
			<h3>Fuel Requirements</h3>
			<p class="topic_para">Vehicles equipped with a catalytic converter are designed
to use ONLY unleaded fuel. Unleaded fuel must be used for the emission control
system to operate properly. Its use will also reduce spark plug
fouling, exhaust system corrosion and engine oil deterioration. </p>
			<p class="topic_para">Using fuel that contains lead will result in damage to the
emission control system and could result in loss of warranty coverage.
The effectiveness of the catalysts in the catalytic converters will
be seriously impaired if leaded fuel is used. The vehicle is equipped
with an engine management system including HO2 sensors. The use
of leaded fuel will damage the HO2 sensors and cause deterioration
of the emission control system. </p>
			<p class="topic_para">Regulations require that pumps delivering unleaded fuel be
labelled UNLEADED. Only these pumps have nozzles which fit the filler neck
of the vehicle fuel tank. Lotus recommends the use of 97 RON unleaded
fuel where available. E5 or E10 petrol used must meet EN228 standard.</p>

			<h3>Lubricants</h3>
			<p class="topic_para">The engine and other lubricating systems are filled with high-performance
lubricants giving prolonged life. </p>
			
				<div class="attention"><p class="caution"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/caution.png" />
					CAUTION:
You should always use a high quality oil of the correct viscosity range
in the engine and gearbox during maintenance and when topping up.
The use of oil not to the correct specification can lead to high
oil and fuel consumption and ultimately to damaged components. </p></div>
			
			<p class="topic_para">Oil to the correct specification contains additives which
disperse the corrosive acids formed by combustion and prevent the formation
of sludge which can block the oil ways. Additional oil additives
should not be used. Always adhere to the recommended servicing intervals.</p>
