					<h3 class="procedure-intro">Important Information</h3>
					
						<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: Transmission oil is a toxic substance and can be lethal if ingested. Wear protective gloves, protective clothing and safety glasses.</p></div>
					
				
				<ol>
					<h3>Check</h3>
					
						<li>Start engine.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Make sure that electrical systems such as air conditioning system, audio system and lighting system are off and let engine coolant temperature rise to normal running temperature.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Using selector, slowly select P R N D buttons, allowing transmission enough time to select each gear, then move selector back to ‘P’ - Park.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Slowly selecting PRND will allow enough time for the fluid to circulate through each part of the transaxle.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Select either ‘P’ - Park or ‘N’ – Neutral.</li>
					
					
						<li>Press and hold ‘P’ – Park button for 15 seconds. Engine coolant temperature display will change to automatic transmission fluid temperature display.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Although display will change, the temperature value will not be shown until transmission fluid temperature rises to over 40°C.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Allow temperature within transmission to rise to 70ºC + so that thermostat opens allowing transmission fluid to circulate around oil cooler system.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: A fluid temperature reading of 70ºC and over is required for the thermostat to open. To raise the fluid temperature it may be necessary to drive the vehicle for a distance of at least 10 miles (16 Km).</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Once thermostat has opened and transmission fluid has completely circulated around the external cooling system, stop engine and allow fluid temperature to drop to 40°C before checking the fluid level.</li>
					
					
						<li>Remove rear undertray. <a href="x10250202-1.html#">Refer to procedure.</a>
						</li>
					
					
						<li>Position a suitable container under overflow plug.</li>
					
					
						<div>

						</div>
						<li>Using a 6 mm hexagon drive socket, remove overflow plug.</li>
						
							<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />WARNING: Hot transmission oil may drain out.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>If transmission oil did not flow out of level/overflow plug hole, top up transmission oil.</li>
					
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<h3>Top Up</h3>
					
						<li>Remove engine bay trim cover rear. <a href="x10131401-3.html#">Refer to procedure.</a>
						</li>
					
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm2495.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Remove bolt securing speedometer blanking plug to transmission.</li>
					
					
						<li>Remove speedometer plug and discard O-ring.</li>
					
					
						<li>Using a suitable funnel, fill transmission with oil through speedometer drive hole until it begins to flow out of overflow plug hole and wait for it to slow down to a drip.</li>
					
					
						<li>Install overflow plug.  <span class="torque">Torque 40 Nm</span>.</li>
					
					
						<li>Start engine and leave to idle for 1 minute to allow transmission oil  to circulate around transmission.</li>
					
					
						<li>Remove level/overflow plug whilst engine is running and discard gasket. If transmission oil flows out wait for it to slow down to a drip.</li>
					
					
						<li>If transmission oil did not flow out, add transmission oil until it flows out of level/overflow plug hole.</li>
					
					
						<li>Install level/overflow plug and new gasket.  <span class="torque">Torque 40 Nm</span>.</li>
					
					
						<li>Install speedometer blanking plug and new O-ring.</li>
					
					
						<li>Install rear undertray.</li>
					
					
						<li>Install bolt securing speedometer blanking plug to transmission.  <span class="torque">Torque 5.5 Nm</span>.</li>
					
					
						<li>Install engine bay trim cover rear.</li>
