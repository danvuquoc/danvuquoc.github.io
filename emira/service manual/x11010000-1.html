				<h2>Door Glass - Alignment</h2><div id="print_button" onClick="window.print()"><span class="print_icon" /><span class="print_txt">Print</span></div><p class="op_code"><a target="_self" href="../labor&#32;times/1101-1.html">Operation Code: 11.01.00-00</a></p>
				<ol>
					<h3>Raising/Lowering Glass During Alignment</h3>
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm2520.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Install window motor to window lift mechanism.</li>
					
					
						<li>Install 5x22 screws (x3) securing window motor to window lift mechanism. </li>
					
					
						<li>Connect harness connectors (x2) to window motor.</li>
					
					
						<li>Support window motor using one hand whilst operating window switch to raise/lower door glass.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Door interior panel must be plugged into door harness to enable window switches to operate window regulator motor.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>To set auto drop, fully raise window and hold switch for 2 seconds until a click is heard. Repeat process for fully lowered position.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Perform with door open.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Close door, raise and lower window to ensure door glass drop is working correctly.</li>
					
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<h3>Level Adjustment</h3>
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm2521.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Install screws (x2) in middle of holes in door glass.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Tolerance between clamp screws and holes in door glass allows for a small amount of rotational adjustment to level door glass.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm2522.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Push door glass forwards into guide rail channel, keeping screws in middle of holes in door glass.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Make sure door glass is located into front door glass channel during installation.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Tighten screws (x2) securing door glass to window lift mechanism.</li>
					
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<h3>Height Adjustment</h3>
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm2523.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Turn screws (x2) on rear of retaining clamps on window lift mechanism to adjust door glass height when in fully closed position.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: On upwards glass movement, when stepped stops of retaining clamps touch corresponding tabs on window lift mechanism runners, a signal is sent to window motor controller module to stop window motor. This adjustment is normally not necessary.</p></div>
						
					
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<h3>Tilt Adjustment</h3>
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm2524.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Using a screwdriver, turn studs (x2) on window lift mechanism runners while using a spanner to tighten the nuts (x2) at the same time to adjust lower edge of door glass inwards/outwards.  <span class="torque">Torque 3.5 Nm</span>.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Studs on a new window lift mechanism are set in the nominal position. It is recommend to install window lift mechanism in position, hold studs in position with a screwdriver and use a spanner to tighten nuts at same time, then see if adjustment is required. Make sure both studs are adjusted equally.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<div>
							<img class="srpgraphic" src="images/asm2525.png"></img>
						</div>
						<li>Adjust window lift mechanism to align rear upper edge of door glass.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Lower mounting brackets of window lift mechanism have a elongated holes to allow inward/outward movement of rear upper edge of door glass for seal engagement.</p></div>
						
					
					
						<li>Tighten M6x16 bolts (x2) securing window lift mechanism to door.  <span class="torque">Torque 7 Nm</span>.</li>
						
							<div><p class="note">NOTE: Holes in base of door provide access to tighten bolts when lower mounting brackets of window lift mechanism are in desired position.</p></div>
