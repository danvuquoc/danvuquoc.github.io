			<h3>General Environmental Precautions</h3>
			<p class="topic_para">This section provides general information which if observed,
can help reduce environmental damage caused by activities carried
out in workshops. </p>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Emissions to air </h4>
				<p class="topic_para">Many of the activities that are carried out in workshops emit
gases and fumes which contribute to global warming, depletion of
the ozone layer and/or the formation of photochemical smog at ground
level. By considering how the workshop activities are carried out,
these gases and fumes can be minimised, thus reducing the impact
on the environment. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Exhaust fumes </h4>
				<p class="topic_para">Running car engines is an essential part of workshop activities
and exhaust fumes need to be ventilated to atmosphere. However,
the amount of time engines are running and the position of the vehicle
should be carefully considered at all times, to reduce the release
of poisonous gases and minimise the inconvenience to people living
nearby. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Solvents </h4>
				<p class="topic_para">Some of the cleaning agents used are solvent based and will
evaporate to atmosphere if used carelessly, or if cans are left
unsealed. All solvent containers should be firmly closed when not
being used and solvent should be used sparingly. Suitable alternative
methods may be available to replace some of the commonly used solvents.
Similarly, many paints are solvent based and the spray should be
minimised to reduce solvent emissions.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Refrigerant </h4>
				<p class="topic_para">It is illegal to release any refrigerants into the atmosphere.
Discharge and replacement of these materials from air conditioning
units should only be carried out using the correct equipment. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Checklist </h4>
				<p class="topic_para">Always adhere to the following: </p>
				<div id="sub-topic">
					<h4>Engines:</h4>
					<ul class="bulllist">
						<li class="bullitem">
							<p>Do not leave engines running unnecessarily.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="bullitem">
							<p>Minimise testing times and check where the exhaust
fumes are being blown. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="sub-topic">
					<h4>Discharges to water:</h4>
					<ul class="bulllist">
						<li class="bullitem">
							<p>Most sites will have two systems for discharging
water: storm drains and foul drains. Storm drains should only receive clean
water, foul drains will take dirty water. </p>
						</li>
						<li class="bullitem">
							<p>The foul drain will accept many of the normal waste
waters such as washing water, detergents and domestic type wastes but
oil, petrol, solvent, acids, hydraulic oil, antifreeze and other
such substances should never be poured down the drain. If in any
doubt, consult the Water Authority responsible for your locality
first. </p>
						</li>
						<li class="bullitem">
							<p>Every precaution must be taken to prevent spillage
of oil, fuel, solvents etc. reaching the drains. All handling of
such materials must take place well away from the drains and preferably
in an area with a kerb or wall around it, to prevent discharge into
the drain. If a spillage occurs, it should be soaked up immediately.
Having a spill kit available will make this easier. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="sub-topic">
					<h4>Additional Precautions:</h4>
					<ul class="bulllist">
						<li class="bullitem">
							<p>Check whether the surface water drains
are connected to an oil/water separator, this could reduce the pollution
if an incident was to occur. Oil/water separators do need regular
maintenance to ensure effectiveness. </p>

substances. They can be in granular form, ready to use and bought
in convenient containers for storage. Disposal of used spill-absorbing
material is dealt with in 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Land contamination</h4>
				<p class="topic_para">Oil, fuels and solvents etc. can contaminate any soil that
they are allowed to contact. Such materials should never be disposed
of by pouring onto soil and every precaution must be taken to prevent
spillage reaching soil. Waste materials stored on open ground could
also leak or have polluting substances washed off them that would
contaminate the land. Always store these materials in suitable skips
or other similarly robust containers. </p>
			</div>

						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Legal compliance </h4>
				<p class="topic_para">Some sites may have a discharge consent for effluent discharge
to the foul drain for a car wash etc. It is important to know what
materials are allowed in the drain and to check the results of any
monitoring carried out by the local Water authority.</p>
				<p class="topic_para">Where paint-spraying operations are carried out, it may be
necessary to apply to the Local Authority for an air emissions licence
to operate the plant. If such a licence is in operation, additional
precautions will be necessary to comply with the requirements, and
the results of any air quality monitoring must be checked regularly.</p>

			<h3>Ball And Roller Bearings </h3>
			<p class="topic_para">When removing and installing bearings, ensure that the following
practices are observed to ensure component serviceability.</p>
			<ul class="bulllist">
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Remove all traces of lubricant from bearing under
inspection by cleaning with a suitable degreasant; maintain absolute
cleanliness throughout operations.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Conduct a visual inspection for markings on rolling
elements, raceways, outer surface of outer rings or inner surface
of inner rings. Reject any bearings found to be marked, since marking
in these areas indicates onset of wear.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Hold inner race of bearing between finger and thumb
of one hand and spin outer race to check that it rotates absolutely
smoothly. Repeat, holding outer race and spinning inner race.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Rotate outer ring gently with a reciprocating motion,
while holding inner ring; feel for any check or obstruction to rotation.
Reject bearing if action is not perfectly smooth.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Lubricate bearing with generous amounts of lubricant
appropriate to installation.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Inspect shaft and bearing housing for discolouration
or other markings which indicate movement between bearing and seating.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Ensure that shaft and housing are clean and free
from burrs before fitting bearing.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>If one bearing of a pair shows an imperfection,
it is advisable to replace both with new bearings; an exception
could be if the faulty bearing had covered a low mileage, and it
can be established that damage is confined to only one bearing.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Never refit a ball or roller bearing without first
ensuring that it is in a fully serviceable condition.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>When hub bearings are removed or displaced, new
bearings must be fitted; do not attempt to refit the old hub bearings. When
fitting a bearing to a shaft, only apply force to the inner ring
of the bearing. When fitting a bearing into a housing, only apply force
to the outer ring of the bearing.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>In the case of grease lubricated bearings (e.g.
hub bearings) fill the space between bearing and outer seal with
the recommended grade of grease before fitting seal.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Always mark components of separable bearings (e.g.
taper roller bearings) when dismantling, to ensure correct reassembly. Never
fit new rollers in a used outer ring; always fit a new bearing assembly.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Oil Seals</h3>
			<p class="topic_para">Always renew oil seals which have been removed from their
working location (whether as an individual component or as part
of an assembly). <b>NEVER</b> use a seal which
has been improperly stored or handled, such as hung on a hook or
nail.</p>
			<ul class="bulllist">
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Carefully examine seal before fitting
to ensure that it is clean and undamaged.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Ensure the surface on which the new seal is to run
is free of burrs or scratches. Renew the component if the original
sealing surface cannot be completely restored.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Protect the seal from any surface which it has to
pass when being fitted. Use a protective sleeve or tape to cover
the relevant surface.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Lubricate the sealing lips with a recommended lubricant
before use to prevent damage during initial use. On dual lipped
seals, smear the area between the lips with grease. Note: some oil
seals are coated with a protective wax and must be fitted dry, unless
instructed otherwise.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>If a seal spring is provided, ensure that it is fitted
correctly. Place lip of seal towards fluid to be sealed and slide
into position on shaft. Use fitting sleeve where possible to protect
sealing lip from damage by sharp corners, threads or splines. If
a fitting sleeve is not available, use plastic tube or tape to prevent
damage to the sealing lip.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Grease outside diameter of seal, place square to
housing recess and press into position using great care, and if
possible a ‘bell piece‘ to ensure the seal is not tilted. In some
cases it may be preferable to fit seal to housing before fitting
to shaft. Never let weight of unsupported shaft rest in seal.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Use the recommended service tool to fit an oil seal.
If the correct service tool is not available, use a suitable tube
approximately 0.4 mm (0.015 in) smaller than the outside diameter
of the seal. Use a hammer VERY GENTLY on drift if a suitable press
is not available. </p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Press or drift the seal in to the depth of its housing,
with the sealing lip facing the lubricant to be retained if the
housing is shouldered, or flush with the face of the housing where
no shoulder is provided. Ensure that the seal does not enter the housing
in a tilted position.</p>

be loosened to accept a split-pin, except in recommended cases when
this forms part of an adjustment.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="bullitem">
					<p>Do not allow oil or grease to enter blind threaded
holes. The hydraulic action on screwing in the bolt or stud could
split the housing. </p>

				<h4>Fuel system hoses </h4>
				<p class="topic_para">All fuel hoses are made up of two laminations, an armoured
rubber outer sleeve and an inner viton core. If any of the fuel
system hoses have been disconnected, it is imperative that the internal
bore is inspected to ensure that the viton lining has not become
separated from the armoured outer sleeve. A new hose must be fitted
if separation is evident.</p>

			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Hose orientation and connection</h4>
				<p class="topic_para">Correct orientation of cooling hoses is important in ensuring
that the hose does not become fatigued or damaged through contact with
adjacent components. Where ‘timing’ marks are provided on the hose
and corresponding connection, these must be used to ensure correct
orientation. Hoses must be pushed fully onto their connection points. Usually,
a moulded form on the stub pipe provides a positive indicator.</p>
				<p class="topic_para">If no markings are visible on the hose to indicate a clip
position, position the clip directly behind the retaining lip at
the end of the stub as shown. Worm drive clips should be oriented with
the crimped side of the drive housing facing towards the end of
the hose, or the hose may become pinched between the clip and the stub
pipe retaining lip. Worm drive clips should be tightened to 3 Nm
(2 lbf.ft) unless otherwise stated.</p>

in good condition. Replace if damage is evident. Particular care
must be taken when routing hoses close to hot engine components,
such as the exhaust manifold and the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)
pipe. Hoses will relax and deflect slightly when hot; ensure this
movement is taken into account when routing and securing hoses.</p>

your local Fire Officer. </p>
				<ul class="bulllist">
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Fuel vapour is highly flammable and in confined
spaces is also explosive and toxic. The vapour is heavier than air
and will always fall to the lowest level. The vapour can be easily
distributed throughout a workshop by air currents; consequently, even
a small spillage of fuel is potentially very dangerous. </p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Always have a fire extinguisher containing FOAM,
CO2, GAS or POWDER close at hand when handling or draining fuel
or when dismantling fuel systems. Fire extinguishers should also
be located in areas where fuel containers are stored. </p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Always relieve the fuel system pressure prior to
disconnecting any fuel system component: refer to service notes
for further information.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Even with the fuel system pressure relieved, there
may still be some residual pressure, therefore to prevent exposing skin,
face and eyes from fuel spray, cover any hoses, pipes or connectors
with a suitable cloth before disconnecting any fuel tubes, pipes,
hoses or connectors to absorb any excess fuel due to spillage.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Always disconnect the negative battery cable unless
the repair or test procedure requires that battery voltage be applied.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Always replace worn or disturbed fuel fitting ‘O’
rings with new ones.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Where a fuel grade specification hose is used, do
not replace with an unsuitable hose or a hose of a lessor grade specification.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Wear protective goggles and gloves especially when
disconnecting fuel tubes, pipes, hoses or connectors.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Only perform repairs on a fuel system in a well-ventilated
area of the workshop.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>DO NOT work on the vehicle either underground or
in an area where fuel vapours may fill the workshop because of poor
ventilation.</p>

						<p>If fuel is spilled, then clean up the area using
a dry cloth immediately to remove fuel vapours.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Dry any cloths in a well-ventilated area that have
been contaminated with fuel. Once dry, dispose of them according
to any applicable local regulations.</p>

						<p>Do not avoid fuel spray or fuel vapours coming into
contact with a spark or open flame:</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>DO NOT smoke near any areas where a vehicles fuel
system is being worked on.</p>

						<p>DO NOT use metal hammers while working, due to the
risk of flying sparks.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">

The airbag system can maintain sufficient voltage to cause an airbag
deployment for up to 20 seconds after the battery has been disconnected. Before
working on the airbag system, or in close proximity to an airbag,
ALWAYS following the process to disable the SRS system:</p></div>
			
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Disabling the SRS system</h4>
				<ul class="bulllist">
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Turn off the ignition</p>
					</li>
					
						<div><p class="note">NOTE: Do not disconnect the battery for at least 30
minutes after switching off the ignition to allow the engine management
system and associated sensors to shut down in the correct sequence.</p></div>
					
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Disconnect the negative (earth) lead from the battery
and tape back to ensure that no contact with the battery negative
terminal can be made.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Wait for 30 seconds before disconnecting any airbag
system harness or removing a module.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>When working on the SRS system, correct PPE should
be worn at all times including an anti-static wrist band.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bullitem">
						<p>Safety precautions must be observed when handling
a deployed inflator module. After deployment, the air bag surface
may contain a white packing powder used to ease deployment. Always
wear gloves and safety glasses when handling a deployed inflator
module and wash your hands with a mild soap and water afterwards.</p>

					<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />
						WARNING:
Handle the SDM with great care. Never strike or jar the SDM as this
could cause airbag deployment and result in personal injury or improper operation
of the SRS.</p></div>
				
				
					<div class="attention"><p class="warning"><img class="attentionicon" src="images/warning.png" />
