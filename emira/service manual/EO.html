			<h3>Labour Operation Code Structure</h3>
			<p class="topic_para">To rationalise the information contained within the service
notes, the removal, installation and/or replacement procedure information contained
within each section has been divided into specific assembly areas
or ‘function groups’ of the vehicle.</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Every labour operation code consists of an 8-digit number,
digit numbers 1 - 6 are the function code, digit numbers 7 - 8 are
the work code.</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Example:</p>
			<p class="topic_para">31.01.06-02 Wheel Bearing Assembly - Front - Left Side</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Digits 1 &amp; 2 of the function code refer to the major function
group, such as suspension:</p>
			<p class="topic_para">31 - Suspension </p>
			<p class="topic_para">Digits 3 &amp; 4 refer to a general component, such as front
suspension:</p>
			<p class="topic_para">01 - Front Suspension</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Digits 5 &amp; 6 refer to a specific part, such as wheel bearing
assembly:</p>
			<p class="topic_para">06 - Wheel Bearing Assembly - Front - Left Side</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Digits 7 &amp; 8 are the work code:-00 Test/adjust-01 Remove
and Refit (R &amp; R)-02 Renew-03 Renew including paint-04 Overhaul-05
Renew - unit out of car-06 Retrofit-07 Modify</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Selecting the operation code number link underneath the component
description at the top of the 1st page of the procedure will direct you
to the relevant labour time information for all components associated
with that function group.</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Unless otherwise stated the operation codes listed are ‘stand
alone’ times. Only where reference is made to another operation
code, should multiple operation times be claimed.</p>
			<p class="topic_para">If the particular part to be claimed for is not illustrated,
or if an operation code is not listed, then please contact the warranty
department for prior authorisation. Please see the criteria for
pre-authorisation as shown in the Lotus Cars warranty policy and
procedures manual.</p>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Labour times</h4>
				<p class="topic_para">Using the decimal clock system, the times listed against each
of the operations are those required by a suitably skilled technician provided
with appropriate facilities and special tools (when applicable)
working at normal speed and using procedures detailed in the applicable
service notes manual sections.</p>

				<h4>Suggested labour time changes</h4>
				<p class="topic_para">If a labour time is considered incorrect, then contact the
warranty department, with detailed information of the exact work
procedure, also describing the reason the listed time is incorrect
and any other information to enable the report to be accurately
analysed.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sub-topic">
				<h4>Diagnosis and testing</h4>

numbers and an associated illustration to depict the tool. Where

operations also include reference to wear limits, relevant data,
torque figures, and specialist information and useful assembly details</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Some removal/installation procedures for components shown
within a procedure may have already been described within another section
of the service notes. When this occurs, a link is shown and when
selected you will be directed to that procedure.</p>
			<p class="topic_para">Installation information is shown after the removal procedure
